## üßò About This Project

**Payapa** is a custom-built website for a wellness and spa studio based in Quezon City, Philippines.  
The word *payapa* translates to *peaceful*‚Äîand that‚Äôs exactly what this digital experience aims to reflect.

This site was designed and developed to:

- Tell the brand story through calming interactions and minimal aesthetics  
- Showcase services and testimonials with smooth, subtle motion  
- Invite bookings and inquiries through a clean, mobile-first experience  

It was a passion project‚Äîequal parts creative exploration and technical refinement.
